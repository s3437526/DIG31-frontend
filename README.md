TODO
- Menu buttons (icons) have tooltip that says "Home"
- Empty all arrays when signing out
- Fix active button indication
- Clear inputs after signin and signup
- Add imageURL and bio for user registration
- Signup doesn't work because it needs to correlate toggle buttons to schema-approved values
- Signin doesn't work because the sender form object isn't consistently sent to the submit handler and errors out with undefined
- Hide signup form after sining up
- Test creating user with admin signed in
- Convert admin toggles to actual form values
